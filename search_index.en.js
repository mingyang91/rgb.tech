BitMask in\nWeb); it also has stable results on end-to-end tests, including performing\nmultiple complex transfers of multiple assets. Finally, wallet developers may\nuse BDK integration developed by Bitfinex team. \nYou can read more about RGB v0.10 functionality in our previous announcement.\nRelease notes and source code can be found at \nhttps://github.com/RGB-WG/rgb/releases/tag/v0.10.0\nContributors\nWe are grateful for everybody involved in stabilizing RGB, including teams\nfrom LNP/BP Standards Association, Pandora Prime,\nBitfinex and DIBA, as well as independent contributors.\n\ndr-orlovsky\nzoedberg\ncrisdut\ncryptoquick\nnicbus\n6293\nclaudiosdc\nmonaka\njosediegorobles\nDimi8146\nrct-k\nlouneskmt\nkaiwolfram\nfedsten\nUkolovaOlga\ngiacomozucco\n\n","id":"https://rgb.tech/blog/release-v0-10-stable/","title":"RGB v0.10 becomes stable"},"https://rgb.tech/blog/release-v0-10/":{"body":"TL;DR\nLNP/BP Standards Association https://www.lnp-bp.org, supported by Fulgur \nVentures, Bitfinex, Hojo Foundation, Pandora Prime, and DIBA, is happy to\nannounce the release of RGB v0.10 - the next significant milestone in the \nRGB protocol https://rgb.tech which brings full support of smart contracts\nto Bitcoin and Lightning. This is the result of a great cross-industry \nlong-term collaboration between these bitcoin companies and more than four \nyears of extensive development work.\nRGB v0.10 can be downloaded and installed as described on https://rgb.tech\nwebsite, which also contains a number of user and developer guidelines.\nRGB source code can be found on https://github.com/RGB-WG\nBackground of RGB\nSome of you might remember the announcement of RGB protocol idea back in\n2018 1: it was an idea of “colored coins” over Lightning by Giacomo\nZucco, based on new concepts developed by Peter Todd - client-side-validation\nand single-use-seals.\nIn 2019 me (Maxim Orlovsky) and Giacomo Zucco formed the LNP/BP Standard\nAssociation, aiming to bring RGB from the concept to production. The initiative\nwas supported by Bitfinex and Fulgur Ventures. My goal with RGB was not just to\nenable assets on Lightning, but that of a much larger scope: to build a\nprogrammability layer for Bitcoin and Lightning, which may unlock other cases\nthan just tokens: DAOs, decentralized identities and many more things which\nbitcoin itself was lacking. This took much longer than was expected, and both \nmyself and the LNP/BP Standards Association had gone through very turbulent\ntimes on this road, relying on self-financing for more than a year...\nNevertheless, in 2021 we were able to present both RGB powered with a\nTuring-complete virtual machine (AluVM) 2 and RGB had became operational on\nLightning Network 3 using the LNP Node - a complete rust re-implementation of\nthe Lightning protocol made by me at the Association 4. Those who are\ninterested in the history of RGB development and our past releases may refer\nto it graphical representation 5 - or navigate through three years of\nvideos and demos on our YouTube channel\nhttps://www.youtube.com/@LNPBP/videos.\nDespite 4 years of active development, weekly community calls, talks on\nall mainstream bitcoin-only evens and conferences, the awareness about RGB\nin the bitcoin community is still very small - and some bitcoin media put\nas a requirement for us to submit information about RGB to the bitcoin-dev mail\nlist, so that they could see the new technology that has been developed - \nso here we are.\nRGB v0.10\nToday we’d like to announce the next main milestone: release of RGB v0.10,\nwhich includes consensus layer, standard library (used by wallets/exchanges\nfor integration) and a command-line tool.\nv0.10 release is a major milestone which brings RGB further to being a \nproduction-ready system. It introduces the last consensus-breaking changes, \naiming at keeping future RGB versions fully backward-compatible. It also unlocks\nthe last features that were required for implementing fully-functional smart \ncontracts which may be arbitrary customized by contract developers.\nThis release brings the support of the following features to RGB:\n\nGlobal state in RGB contracts\nNow each RGB contract has a global state accessible by a virtual machine\nand clients (wallets etc).\n\nContract interfaces\nInterfaces, introduced in this version, represent a standard way of\ncommunicating a diverse range of smart contracts through well-defined APIs.\nInterfaces can be compared to contract ABIs and ERCs in Ethereum world,\nhowever, unlike in Ethereum, they require neither obligatory standardization\n(as ERCs) nor separate distribution, being always packed together with\ncontracts. By using interfaces, wallets and other software can provide a\nsemantic-aware UI for the users for working with the contracts - and contract\ndevelopers may add more interfaces to their existing contracts over time\nwithout the need to update the immutable contract itself.\n\nStrict type system\nStrict types is a new functional data type system with provable\nproperties used for the RGB contract state representation and introspection.\nIt allows compile-time guarantees on the size of any data, simplifying RGB\noperations on low-end and limited-memory devices like hardware wallets.\nThe whole RGB consensus layer is now compiled into strict types, which\nallows formal proofs of the binary compatibility between releases (the\nfeature which might have been very useful for bitcoin consensus if it existed\nback in the days of Satoshi). You can learn more about strict types on\nhttps://www.strict-types.org\n\nContracts in Rust\nWriting and compiling an RGB smart contracts in Rust. Thanks to the strict\ntypes, it is also possible to compile rust data types right into RGB \ncontracts.\n\nState introspection\nContracts can introspect their own state in the validation code used by the\nvirtual machine, which unlocks the way for writing complex forms of contracts\nworking with bitcoin transactions, DLCs and other complex data.\n\nURL-based invoice format\nPreviously RGB was using Bech32m-encoded invoices, which were very long,\nnot human-readable and couldn't be automatically opened with most of the\nsoftware. The new format is much shorter, easier to verify by the user and\ncan be opened automatically as a link with a preconfigured software.\n\nWASM support\nRGB standard library can run without I/O and file system access,\ni.e. can operate inside a web page or a browser plugin.\n\nTapret descriptors and custom derivation\nRGB uses taproot-based OP_RETURN commitments (in short - tapret), which\nrequire support on the descriptor level such that wallets could see the \ntransactions with tweaked outputs as those belonging to the wallet descriptor. \nNew version also introduces custom derivation indexes that prevent non-RGB \nwallets from accidentally spending outputs with RGB assets (and thus -\ndestroying assets).\n\nSimplified dependencies\nRGB consensus layer is being shipped with fewer dependencies, improving the \nstability of API. We have abandoned the dependency on custom bulletproofs \nimplementation from Grin projects. We also do not use rust-bitcoin and \nrust-miniscript due to their overall API instability and recently discovered \nbugs; since RGB uses a very small subset of bitcoin functionality it is now \nimplemented as a part of the library with no assumptions about bitcoin \nconsensus layer (like those which halted rust-bitcoin powered software when \nBurak's hack had happened last year).\n\nSimplified integration\nMany operations that previously required multiple API calls, as well as\ncross-language encoding of complex data structures now work with a\nsingle API call. RGB contract state is represented as a JSON object and\ncan be serialized across different languages without a hassle.\n\nSimplified UX\nPreviously, to use RGB, a wallet or a user had to run the RGB Node, interface\nit through RPC (or cli tool) - and use a number of other libs and command-line \ntools to perform most of the operations on PSBTs etc. With the new release \nthis complex stack was replaced by a single library API and a command-line \ntool rgb, which operate like a swiss knife for RGB user (and it can be \ncompared to the way git works). RGB Node still can be run by users on their\nhome servers, but is not obligatory for using RGB anymore.\n\n\nMigration notes\nThere is no migration from contracts issued on RGB v0.9 to the future versions.\nAll assets have to be re-issued; asset holders can contact asset issuers to\nprovide them with a newly re-issued contracts and assets matching the assets\nfrom v0.9.\nRGB v0.10 can be downloaded and installed as described on [https://rgb.tech]\n(https://rgb.tech) website, which also contains a number of user and\ndeveloper guidelines. RGB source code can be found on https://github.com/RGB-WG\nRoadmap after v0.10\nWith this release the future development of the core RGB technology (at in its\nconsensus layer) becomes gradually ossified, as the cases of \nclient-side-validated systems upgrades are more complex to coordinate than\nthose of blockchain layer 1. Also, the normal understanding of soft-forks and\nhard-forks do not apply to upgrades in layer 2 and 3. So we found a way\nfor backwards-compatible upgrades, which we call “fast-forwards”, where users\nkeep their assets issued under the older versions that can always operate and be\naccepted by the users of any other future version. However, the users of a newer\nversion will be restricted in transferring their assets only to the users of the\nsame or more recent version (but they can always ask recipients to upgrade their\nsoftware). We have a number of features planned for the future fast-forwards:\n\nfull support of bitcoin layer 1 and channel state introspection;\ninter-contract interaction;\nbulletproofs++ support;\nzero-knowledge-based optimizations of the client-side-validated history.\n\nWe're also working on the design of a layer 1 which will be perfect for the\nclient-side-validated applications (“how to design a blockchain today if we\nknew about client-side-validation/single-use-seals”). This should be very\ncompact (order of one signature per block) ultra-scalable (theoretically\nunlimited no of tx in a block) chain which can run systems like RGB - with\nBitcoin UTXO set migrated into RGB operating on both bitcoin blockchain and\nthis new chain (we code-name it “sigchain”). However, these are quite early\ndevelopments with a number of unsolved tradeoffs and challenges; if there is\nan interest on this topic here we can start a different discussion thread\non the matter.\nSoftware and integrations\nCompanies, which are a part of the LNP/BP Standards Association, as well\nas other independent vendors are already working on upgrading their software\nto v0.10. This includes (but not limited to):\n\nMyCitadel wallet (iOS, Desktop)\nIris wallet (Android) from RGB team inside Bitfinex\nBitMask (Web browser plugin) from DIBA\nLNP Node with RGB support - lightning node from the LNP/BP Standards Association\nRGBEx.io - website listing RGB assets and contracts,\nusing pseudonymous credentials (public key + signatures)\nRGB Tools library - SDK based on BitcoinDevKit for RGB wallet integration\nLightningDevKit with RGB support - again by RGB team in Bitfinex\nCore Lightning RGB plugin\n\nLNP/BP Standards Association will focus its further development activity\naround these three areas:\n\nCompleting RGB documentation, specification and helping public audits of the\ntechnology. Right now we have a nearly-complete RGB whitepaper 6 a codified\nstandards 7\nLightning network support for complex RGB smart contracts - the thing we name\n#BiFi (Bitcoin finance) 8. It includes further development of Storm -\na decentralized data storage &amp; messaging network on top of Lightning, that we\npresented last year.\nRGB toolchain, which includes a new high-level functional smart contracting\nlanguage called Contractum (https://www.contractum.org) and other tools\nwhich will simplify the life of RGB devs.\n\nSources of information\nWe have already witnessed some actors distributing misinformation about\nnon-existing products released with/on RGB even before the official releases of\nsome RGB components happened. Thus, we advise all media people to always check\nthe official sources before publishing information about the RGB protocol.\nAll releases and major things are being announced on:\n\nOfficial website of the protocol https://rgb.tech,\ncommunity https://rgbfaq.com and LNP/BP Standards Association\nhttps://lnp-bp.org.\nTwitter of the Association: https://twitter.com/lnp_bp\nCommunity telegram channel: https://t.me/rgbtelegram\n\nOther websites are not in control of the RGB protocol developers and are not\nopen-source and should not be considered to be trusted sources of information.\n","id":"https://rgb.tech/blog/release-v0-10/","title":"RGB release v0.10"},"https://rgb.tech/blog/release-v0-11-beta-5/":{"body":"LNP/BP Standards Association is happy to announce the fifth beta release of RGB protocol version 0.11.\nThis is another milestone on the stabilization of the new v0.11 RGB version. It is the first\ncomplete beta release of both consensus-level libraries, standard libraries and tools happening\nin 2024, opening a way for independent developers integrating with RGB to test all the new\nfunctionality.\nWhat's new in Beta 5\nIn preparing Beta 5 release we were focusing on performing internal audit of all consensus-critical\ncode, ensuring both its security and ability to do a protocol upgrades in the future versions\nwithout introducing any incompatibilities with the assets and software using v0.11.\nThe internal audit was performed by two teams: the dev team and documentation team. The developer\nteam was reviewing the source code and modelling different types of attacks; while the doc team\nwas independently creating formal specification explaining how the protocol actually works (basing\non the source code), which was later compared to the expected protocol behaviour.\nLet's walk through the major areas of the improvements shipping in v0.11 beta 5.\nCommitments\nCryptographic commitments, which go into Bitcoin blockchain in hidden form, are the core of RGB \nsecurity and anti-double-spending protection. They are a part of so-called “single-use seals”, \nwhich you may have heard of before.\nDuring the last three months (since Beta 3) we have passed through an extensive internal audit \nof the commitment procedures and wrote a lot of tests. We have improved the security and safety \nof many aspects of them and made sure they will be a proper foundation for the RGB.\nOne of the main changes which the end-users will notice is that now contracts (and assets) will \ncommit to the issuer identity, simplifying the verification by the wallets and preventing scam \nattacks.\nContractum language and scripting\nWith v0.11 one of our main focuses was simplification of RGB developer experiences.\nFirst, we have introduced more opcodes allowing scripts in RGB contracts to access the contract \nstate and use that information in validation. We have also developed RGB assembly, which can be \ncompiled using macro rgbasm directive right from the Rust!\nFinally, we are moving fast in finalizing the initial Contractum version: the language intended \nfor RGB smart contract developers. In this release we add a Contractum representation for all \nstandard interfaces used by RGB (RGB20 fungible assets, RGB21 NFTs and RGB25 fungible collections).\nWallet functionality\nWith v0.11 RGB is integrated with wallet functionality out of the box. This solves one of the \nmajor dev and user headaches.\nWith Beta 5, we are going even further: now the command-line tool and RGB runtime can filter and \npresent the information specific to a wallet of user choice and ignore the rest of the contract \nstate.\nAnother new feature is the support for legacy Electrum RPC API, in addition to Esplora REST APIs, \nsupported before.\nContainers\nIn this beta we have refactored the concept of containers. Containers are they way user exchange \nRGB data, for instance when they do distribute assets, perform transfers, -- or when developers \ndistribute new code and interfaces for asset issuers.\nIn Beta 5 we have improved ASCII armoring of container data, so all of them now use more compact \nBase85 encoding and standard set of headers. We have simplified programming API for working with \ncontainers, and made sure their IDs are uniquely reflect their content - such that even the same \ncontract disclosing different parts of information will have a distinct id.\nWe also simplified a life of devs and testers by providing an ability to convert any container \ninto a human-readable YAML representation, edit it and convert back into a binary form, which \ncan go into RGB system. This will simplify audit and debugging, allowing us to model different \nkinds of attacks on the system.\nAbout RGB v0.11\nRGB v0.11 is an evolution of the protocol coming with a lot of bug fixes and improvements, further\nenhancing RGB smart contracting capabilities. It will be the first version which will be audited by\nindependent auditors, after which it can be considered by third-party issuers for the use in\nproduction.\nThe main features shipping in v0.11 will be:\n\nWallet integration right into RGB runtime and command-line tool;\nBasic support for Liquid sidechain, with ability to add more alternative scalability layers in the \nfuture;\nScripting, with new state introspection codes and RGB assembly compiler;\nInitial support for Contractum language;\nAbility to inherit interfaces (multiple inheritance!);\nSupport of Electrum RPC additionally to Esplora REST, present before;\nCommitments to issuer and developer identities embedded into contracts, interfaces, libraries;\nMore compact consignments and better ASCII armoring.\n\nWhat's next\nWith Beta 5 release RGB development enters a new phase of preparation for a public preview of \nthe RGB v0.11. The public preview will be a feature-complete version which will be used by \nexternal auditors for evaluating the safety of the protocol. At the same time app devs and users \nwill be able to complete integration of RGB without expecting major API or consensus break with \nthe release.\nOnce there will be results of an audit, the preview version will become an official release (if \nthe audit will find any major issues however, they will be fixed even if the fixes will contain \na breaking changes).\nYou can track us on our journey towards v0.11 release with this GitHub dashboard.\nAcknowledgements\nWe are grateful to Fulgur Ventures, providing another year of support for our efforts in \ndeveloping RGB. This year they were joined by Bitlight Labs, who had become a new full member of \nthe Association.\nWe have received a number of important contributions and bugfixes coming from commercial \ncompanies, such as Pandora Prime, Bitfinex and DIBA. We are also grateful for individual \ncontributors, who do their small -- but still highly valuable and welcomed input in making RGB \nbetter.\n","id":"https://rgb.tech/blog/release-v0-11-beta-5/","title":"RGB v0.11 Beta 5 is out"},"https://rgb.tech/blog/release-v0-11-beta-6/":{"body":"LNP/BP Standards Association is happy to announce the sixth beta release of RGB version 0.11.\nThe release marks a reference point for public audit of RGB v0.11. The APIs are now stable, and\nfeature-freeze has been reached: no further consensus-level or standard library breaking changes are\nplanned (unless they would become required as a result of newly discovered bugs/issues by the\ncommunity or auditors).\nOur main focus with Beta 6 was:\n\nensure with end-to-end tests that any execution routes and user stories doesn't contain bugs and\npreform correctly;\nrefactor consensus and security-critical code in order to decrease its size and reduce potential\nattack surface as much as possible;\nmake sure that RGB will be able to evolve in the future without introducing backward-incompatible\nchanges.\n\nAll developers working with RGB are urged to update to the new version and use it to ensure\ncross-application interoperability between assets, invoices, consignments and other RGB exchange\ndata.\nUnless required, no further beta releases are planned and RGB v0.11 enters public testing and\npre-production preview cycle.\nWhat's new in Beta 6\nBeta 6 contain one of the largest changelog: we have fixed, closed and merged more than 120 issues\nand pull requests. More than 20 engineers, both from LNP/BP Standards Association member companies\nand independent third-parties has contributed since last Beta 5 release by reviewing, discussing and\nproposing PRs to the RGB codebase across ~50 repositories related to the project.\nThe complete list of all closed issues and pull requests can be found on the public RGB roadmap\npage; below we review the most important of them:\nConsensus-level changes\nBeta 6 implements four proposals for consensus-level changes coming from the\nRGB change proposals:\n\nRCP-240227A: Make timestamp part of genesis\nRCP-240227B: Make issuer identity part of genesis\nRCP-240313B: Move script and type libraries outside of schema, interfaces and operations\nRCP-240326A: Multiple metadata fields in contract operations\n\nOther than that, we have:\n\nMoved information about asset tags, used in homomorphic encryption of the contract state, from\nstandard library to contract genesis and adding them to the contract commitments; also \nsignificantly simplifying making contract operations which involve these tags;\nImproved multichain support, such that RGB contracts can run on top of multiple layer 1 soultions.\nThis gives contract users ability to do cheaper and faster transactions using Liquid network,\nand benefit from the new client-side validated layer 1 called Prime, scheduled for the release\nlater;\nNew virtual machine op-codes for introspecting smart contract state and simplified branching\nop-codes making scripts more streamlined;\nMore RGB macro assembly instructions allowing to write complex verification code;\nImproved checking and handling of strings with restricted character set, like the ones used for\nRGB20 asset tickers and names;\nRefactored mechanism for combining different types of single-use seals (like tapret- and \nopret-based) in inputs of a state transitions;\nRemoved legacy schema inheritance feature in favor of new advanced interface inheritance, which\nis implemented outside of consensus code (see below).\n\nAdditionally, we have put a consensus changes required to make the following proposals \nfast-forwards, which means that they can be implemented in a future releases (like v0.12 etc) \nwithout consensus-breaking changes:\n\nRCP-240313A: SPV proofs for anchor transactions\nRCP-240327A: Computed state\nRCP-240406A: Fallback single-use-seal\n\nWe have also adjusted the complexity counter for reserved RGB op-code values, which ensures that\nadding more op-codes to the virtual machine can be done in a backward-compatible manner.\nOverall, with all those changes the size of consensus code in RGB Core library has decreased from\n7170 to 6726 lines of Rust code (LORC), excluding comments and blank lines, which is \n&gt;6% reduction.\nInterfaces and inheritance\nInterface inheritance is the brand-new way of designing RGB smart contract interfaces which brings\nmuch better modularity, audibility and upgradeability for the contracts.\nInterfaces are defined at the level above consensus and specify how software or a user can interact\nwith a given contract. Interface defines a semantic for a business logic of a contract, and\ncontract developers write an implementations linking that business logic to the semantics. In\nother words, interface explains to the user the meaning of a smart contract. One example is RGB20:\nan interface (which becomes a family of interfaces in beta 6) which all contracts with a fungible\ntokens can implement to be supported by any RGB wallet. The fact that interfaces are not a part of\nthe consensus level allows contract developers to gradually provide more and more advanced APIs\nwithout a need to re-issue an assets or create new contract versions. On the other hand, users may\ninteract with smart contracts using newly released interfaces without the need of a wallet software\nto be upgraded.\nPreviously RGB v0.11 beta 6 there were no interface inheritance, meaning that a contract can\nimplement a given interface only once; and must provide all of its functionality at once. Now, with\ninterface inheritance, this can become a gradual process. For instance, today RGB20 standard defines\nwhat fungible assets can do. In a future a new features can be added to the standard (like reserves\nor vesting), implemented as a new interfaces inheriting existing RGB20 interfaces and implemented\nby existing assets which had that functionality in their business logic – and wallets will be able\nto handle them in a correct way without any software upgrades.\nAs a part of the work on interfaces and inheritance, we have refactored the way errors can be\nreported from smart contract validation scripts. Now, you can provide detailed error messages as\nstrings inside interface definitions and link them to raised errors via integer codes in\nimplementations.\nAt the same time interface inheritance brings much better modularity and audibility: you can compare\nRGB20 standard \nbefore the inheritance was introduced\nand now.\nWe have re-implemented all previosly-defined interface standards (RGB-20, 21 and 25) as standard\nsets (\"families\") of related interfaces and re-designed the APIs for working with them.\nFinally, with beta 6 we added a number of interface and implementation integrity and validity\nchecks, which should simplify the work of developers and debugging.\nThe details of how the inheritance works can be found in\nRCP-240325A: Interface inheritance proposal.\nInvoicing\nWe also have made few changes to the invoicing. In RGB, invoices are form of URIs (like URLs), and\nthus can be opened with one-click in your favorite wallet.\nWith beta 6 we changed the format for displaying asset amount inside the invoice. RGB20 standard,\nlike many other asset standards in other systems (ERC20 etc) allow to specify a precision for asset\namounts. Invoices contain information about the amount with no precision, creating a lot of\nconfusion for users, as well as a attack surface. Starting from the current release we hide the\namounts behind custom latin letter encoding (modified Base32 encoding with no numbers used),\nremoving the problem. To read an invoice a user must use wallet or other software, which will parse\nit for the user using correct precision from the contract information. To simplify working with such\namounts we provide a new CoinAmount type which embeds information about precision and is handy for\npresenting asset values in the UI.\nFinally, invoices has changed they way a pay-to-address requests are handled. Previously, an\nexplicit bitcoin address was used; now we standardized that with usual blind seal definitions using\nthe same encoding, chunking and supporting incorporation of custom seal close method information.\nLast, but not least, we have optimized identities we use across RGB (like contracts, interfaces etc)\n– it was switched from Baid58 to Baid64 encoding, which resulted in shorter fixed-length identifiers,\nrobust chunking, and solved few issues with its URI standard compatibility and chunking.\nData containers\nWith client-side validation, all the contract state, new state transitions and history are sent\nbetween peers, in a P2P way. This is quite different from the blockchain-bases systems and require\nspecific methods of storing and sharing the data: data containers.\nThere are several types of data containers in RGB. In v0.11 beta 6 we have put a lot of\noptimizations into the way containers work, making them more compact and secure.\nPreviously, information for smart contract developers – interfaces, schemata and interface\nimplementations were always present as a separate files. With beta 6 we introduce kits: new data\ncontainer type which may store multiple interfaces, schemata, implementations and other data in one\nsingle package. We have also made sure that repeated information – like data type or script\nlibraries which can be re-used by different interfaces and contracts – is shipped only once,\nreducing the size of data containers for about a dozen of percents.\nAnother type of data containers are consignments, used to distribute smart contracts, assets and do\ntransfers. Consignments has also become smaller, since they also include all related interfaces and\nimplementations and thus do benefit from aggregation of data type and script libraries.\nPreviosly containers were packed with mechanism called bindles. With beta 6, we deprecate bindles,\nwhich simplify the standard library API.\nSpecial attention was paid to supplements: non-consensus meta information added to consignments,\nand kits – like custom icons for assets etc. We have rewritten supplement API and made them really\nextensible, such that new types of information and annotations can be added without requiring\nupdates to the standard library.\nData containers are binary files, but RGB supports a special ASCII-armored text representation using\nBase85 encoding. We added few improvements to the ASCII armoring, like more informative headers,\nwhich now may contain lists; verification of checksums and increased number of characters per line\nto reduce file size and text length of the armored data.\nLast, but not least: we are introducing ability for developers and contract issuers to provide their\nidentities and sign interfaces, contracts and other parts of the information, such that wallets can\nuse decentralized web of trust-like functionality to filter trusted and non-trusted sources and\nprotect users. The new identity system is flexible: it can support multiple standards, with PGP/GPG,\nSSH are in pipeline. We also plan to use self-sovereign identities (SSI) developed by LNP/BP\nStandrards Association in partnership with Cyphernet: a new single-use seal based web-of-trust\nstandard for compact and easy-to-use identities.\nOther standard library changes\nThere are more improvements in the standard library APIs, including completed deterministic contract\nand operation creation; simplified API for working with contracts and consignments; many new\ninterface-related APIs and support for accessing and adding metadata and state extension-related\ninformation to the contracts and operations.\nApplication-level changes\nFor the first time, RGB v0.11 comes with embedded wallet support right out of the box. This was one\nof the major pain points for the users and developers. Beta 6 extends and simplifies RGB wallet\nAPIs, as well as improves Electrum and Esplora support.\nToolchain and dev tools\nOn top of standard and wallet libraries RGB v0.11 include a new high-level RGB runtime for software\nintegration and simple command-line tool rgb made with it. In beta 6 we put a lot of effort in\nimproving them further, providing new APIs and commands, as well as improving output presentation\nand information details, including presenting non-asset smart contract state like digital rights,\nattachments and arbitrary structured data. Also, we added commands for debugging and testing smart\ncontracts, like those converting data consignments and stash information into human-readable and\neditable YAML format, also allowing to import it back with some changes; which can be useful for\npenetration testing.\nClient-side-validated data are now kept not as a single file, but as three independent files:\nstash.dat, with critical non-recoverable consensus information; index.dat – indexes and\nstate.dat - cache of the contract state for faster access.\nWe are continuing our work on providing high-level programming language Contractum for RGB\ninterface and contract developers. In beta 6 we included a reverse compiler which translates any\nbinary interface, iterface implementation or a contract into Contractum representation. For\ninstance, all standard interface families, like RGB20 etc, were generated with it.\nOne of the most security-important things coming with beta 6 is the integration end-to-end tests\ndeveloped and contributed by Bitfinex RGB team. They cover about a hunderd of different user\nstories, involving assets issuance and complex multi-asset multi-wallet transfers, involving\ndifferent forms of single use seals and their combination. This tests were the major tool of\ndebugging the new release and with them passing we can now proceed to the next stage: audit and\npenetration testing.\nWhat's next\nWith Beta 6 release RGB development enters a new phase of preparation for a public preview of\nthe RGB v0.11. Beta 6 is recommended to be used by all parties integrating RGB, and after gathering\ntheir feedback (and fixing all newly discovered issues) we will release the public preview version.\nIn parallel, with support from Bitfinex, we are starting working on audit and petentration testing\nof RGB, ensuring the system security and safety before the final release.\nWe continue an ongoing effort of documenting RGB, and with beta 6 stabilizing consensus and standard\nAPIs we plan to review, update and extend all existing documentation and prepare it for a reliease\nalongside the v0.11.\nYou can track us on our journey towards v0.11 release with this GitHub dashboard.\nAbout RGB v0.11\nRGB v0.11 is an evolution of the protocol coming with a lot of bug fixes and improvements, further\nenhancing RGB smart contracting capabilities. It will be the first version which will be audited by\nindependent auditors, after which it can be considered by third-party issuers for the use in\nproduction.\nThe main features shipping in v0.11 are:\n\nWallet integration right into RGB runtime and command-line tool;\nBasic support for Liquid sidechain, with ability to add more alternative scalability layers in the\nfuture;\nScripting, with new state introspection codes and RGB assembly compiler;\nInitial support for Contractum language;\nAbility to inherit interfaces (multiple inheritance!);\nSupport of Electrum RPC additionally to Esplora REST, present before;\nCommitments to issuer and developer identities embedded into contracts, interfaces, libraries;\nMore compact consignments and better ASCII armoring.\n\nContributing\nRGB is a free software and opensourc effort, built by community. The development is supervised by\na non-profit LNP/BP Standards Association, which uses open approach: anybody from the\ncommunity can propose a request for RGB change (RCP), ask a question in discussions, open an\nissue in GitHub, propose a pull request or review pull requests of others. The association also\nmaintains public roadmap summarizing the current development progress and listing all issues\nand pull requests across multiple repositories and github organizations related to the RGB.\nSpecifically, starting from the beta 6 release, we are also looking for qualified auditors and\npenetration testers who can contribute into making RGB more secure and robust. We plan a grant\nprogram to facilitate this process; with any enquiries please contact us via info@lnp-bp.org.\nAcknowledgements\nWe are grateful to Fulgur Ventures, providing another year of support for our efforts in\ndeveloping RGB.

For instance, in Ethereum, if an invalid transaction under some contract is included in the blockchain, the whole\nblockchain becomes invalid (and a different tip is selected). In RGB no global consensus on the validity of all\ncontracts and transactions is required.\nRGB isolates each of the programs (“smart contracts”) in its sandbox environment, which provides much better scalability\nand security than blockchain-based platforms.\nUnlike device-based and Web platforms, RGB doesn’t provide random memory access, I/O, or UI, which makes RGB well-suited\nfor embedded devices and environments.\nOne of the distinctive features of the platform is the use of the functional registry-based virtual machine (#AluVM) and\nfunctional type system.\nRGB is the first computing platform utilizing PRISM computing model, which is closer to cellular automation computing\nthan instruction-based or neural networks. PRISM stands for “partially replicated state machines”, which at their core\nrepresent a highly-parallel multi-agent system made with a functional approach.\nToday, RGB (together with AluVM) can be run on x86, AMD64, Aarch64, microcontrollers, and WASM instruction set\narchitectures, i.e. it is a ubiquitous platform (desktop, mobile, server, embedded, Web).\n","id":"https://rgb.tech/blog/rgb-computing/","title":"RGB as a Computing Platform"},"https://rgb.tech/build/":{"body":"RGB was designed to allow everything that is possible with blockchain-based \nsmart contracts (like in Ethereum and other systems) – but in the scalable,\nrobust and private way.

Consignments may be of two different types:\ncontract consignments, which distribute public contract information from a\ncontract issuer to users, and transfer consignments, which are used for doing\nstate transfers between contract users. In this chapter we will address the\nfirst type of consignments, leaving the second for a next chapter.\nRGB stores all data required for its operations in a storage called stash.\nSince RGB is not a blockchain-based smart contracts, the stash is not replicated\nto other peer machines and usually keeps the data which nobody else than you\nknow or have access to (at least to some of those data). Thus, losing stash\nmeans loosing your assets and contract state, and it has to be backed up with\nthe same effort as a seed phrase or wallet descriptor for a complex wallet\nsetup.\nTo import a contract into your stash one first needs to get a contract\nconsignment from a contract issuer. A contract consignment is either a binary\nfile – or an ASCII/Base64-armoded text (and example can be found it the\n\"issuing contract\" section).\n\nTo list contracts which are part of the stash you need to run rgb commands\nwith no arguments provided (or rgb info as an alternative to this)\n\nWhich should output something like\n\nHere you see your imported contract id, plus a schema, used by this contract\nwhich implements RGB20 interface.

We say invoice executing\ninstead of paying the invoice, since invoice may not contain a payment and\ncarry some other form of action (key revocation, casting a vote etc).\nCreating an invoice\nIn RGB, invoicing is much more general than just an invoice for a certain amount\nof tokens. In fact, you can pack any request for any contract operation, under\nany possible schema and interface in form of invoice: revoking identity, voting\nin DAO, performing secondary asset issuance, creating NFT engraving and so on,\nso on.\nTo construct an invoice one have to run the following command:\n\nHere:\n\n$CONTRACT should be a contract id under which the interaction happens\n$INTERFACE is human-readable interface name which should be used for\ninteracting the contract by both parties, beneficiary and actor. It may be\nskipped, if the contract schema implements just a single interface.\n$ACTION is the name of the operation which should be performed by the\nactor. If it is skipped, it defaults to an operation which declared in the\nused interface as \"default\".\n$STATE provides an information about the state, which should be\ntransferred to the beneficiary single-use-seal defined in the $SEAL\nparameter.

Bob should send this file to Alice by some third-party means - this\ncan be an e-mail, some file server – or one of existing RGB-related protocols,\nlike RGB-RPC, Storm (no Lightning network) or something else.\nUpon receiving the consignment Alice verifies and accepts it to her local\nRGB stash (which keeps information about all Alice contracts and owned\nstate) with the following command:\n\nIf the consignment was invalid, the command will fail and list all problems the\nconsignment had. Otherwise, the command should succeed with a single warning –\nthat the terminal witness transaction is not yet mined. This is due to the fact\nthat Bob hasn't yet published his transaction yet, since he is waiting on Alice\napproval that she is happy with the transfer.\nUpon adding transfer consignment to the stash command will return a signature\nover the consignment, which Alice can send back to Bob as a form of payslip.\nBob can now check Alice's signature, sign and publish his transaction:\n\nAlice's RGB wallet will see the witness transaction mined, after which the\nnew state will appear in her user interface.\n","id":"https://rgb.tech/power-user/transfer/","title":"State transfers"},"https://rgb.tech/program/":{"body":"RGB is a full-fledged smart contract system which operates on top of Bitcoin\nand Lightning network.

RGB scripts and state fully exist in the client-side world, are\nnot seen from the outside (hence privacy) - and are not required to be validated by\nanyone other than the contract participants (hence scalability).\nRGB allows Bitcoin to pass beyond the limitations of the CIA triad (confidentiality,\nintegrity, and availability) by achieving different properties on different layers:\n\nBlockchain provides integrity &amp; availability;\nLightning network – integrity &amp; confidentiality;\nRGB – confidentiality &amp; availability.\n\n","id":"https://rgb.tech/program/","title":"Program RGB"},"https://rgb.tech/program/components/":{"body":"In RGB, there is no such thing as \"program a smart contract\"; instead, contracts\nthemselves are issued with no code. This helps to simplify the life of asset \nissuers and normies, who just need to issue a token, create their self-sovereign\nidentity, run a DAO etc.\nThis is achieved through separation of concerns, where the development work is\nkept outside contracts, thanks to things called schema and interface.\n\nContract\nThe contract is a contract genesis plus a history of operations on the\ncontract. Together they are used by RGB to compute a deterministic contract\nstate. To create a contract means to issue a contract genesis, which \nrequires no code at all. The Contract issuer just needs to pick a schema\nwhich has all features needed in a contract – and use it during the \nissuance. If the schema with the required properties doesn't exist, the issuer\ncan hire a developer to implement such a schema.\n\nSchema\nIf you think in terms of object-oriented programming (OOP), a contract is\nan instance of some class, and in RGB terms this class is named\nschema. Schema contains all the contract business logic, scripts, \ndefinitions of state types (owned and global), allowed operations, rules\nfor validation, data type system etc. Schema by its nature is declarative,\nit can be easily read or written with Rust macros, YAML, TOML and other\ndeclarative languages. Once created, a schema may be used by many contracts\nof the same type.\n\nInterface\nAn interface defines how a user-facing software (wallets etc) can \ninteract with a contract. Interfaces provide semantic information about\nthe contract and defines how its state can be presented to the user.\nIf one can compare schema to a class in OOP, than contract interface\nshould be compared to Java interface or Rust trait. As classes can\nimplement interfaces in Java, or structs can implement traits in Rust,\nin RGB schema can implement many interfaces.\n\n\n","id":"https://rgb.tech/program/components/","title":"Components"},"https://rgb.tech/program/contractum/":{"body":"Contractum is a functional &amp; declarative \nlanguage for writing smart contracts which is a work-in-progress. The first \ncompiler version is planned for a release by the end of 2023; before that you \nmay use this section as a guideline and preview of how the development of RGB \nsmart contracts with contractum may look like in a future.\nContractum is a domain-specific language created with more general functional \nlanguage named ParselTongue. It uses \nStrict Types formalism for defining data \ntypes and is compiled into RGB schema, interfaces, interface \nimplementations, genesis, contract operations and \nAluVM executable code. To learn more about RGB \nschema, interfaces and other related concepts please refer to \nRGB Components section and RGB FAQ\nwebsite.\nWe will demonstrate how RGB with Contractum works in three main steps:\n\nWriting simple contract\nAdding fungible state\nImplementing interfaces\n\n","id":"https://rgb.tech/program/contractum/","title":"Programming with Contractum"},"https://rgb.tech/program/contractum/basics/":{"body":"Let's do a contract which will work as a digital identity.\nWe have to start with definition of a data type representing the key. This is\nnot a part of the contract itself and may be imported into multiple contracts\nfrom a data type library.\n\nAs you might see, the code looks similar to Haskel. New data types are declared\nwith data keyword, and can be composed of named fields (being structs),\nunnamed fields (tuples), operate as enums (in this case you should use\n| instead of ,), or unions, where each variant may in turn have an\nassociated structure or tuple. You may read more about constructing data types\nin strict types guidelines.\nNow, having the data type we can start definition of our schema:\n\nAs you may see, schema declares state which the contract operates, and\noperations, which may update the state.\nThe state can be global and owned. The difference between these two forms of\nstate can be illustrated with following statements:\n\n\nGlobal state: nobody owns, everyone knows\nExamples: asset name\n\n\nOwned state: someone owns, nobody else knows\nExamples: asset amounts, voting rights, NFT content\n\n\nIn our example we do not define a global state yet.\nThere are also three types of operations:\n\nGenesis - a unique operation which takes no input and sets up the contract;\nState transition, which changes some existing owned state (\"inputs\") and\nmay add up to the global state;\nState extensions, which may be seen as a \"decentralized additional\ngeneses\". State extensions do not have input state, but may produce new owned\nstate.\n\nThe schema defines a rules of how the contract operates. Now let's put it into\na practice by creating a specific identity contract, and then doing a revocation:\n\n","id":"https://rgb.tech/program/contractum/basics/","title":"Writing simple contract"},"https://rgb.tech/program/contractum/fungibles/":{"body":"Now, let's add some tokens to the contract, in form of \"I owe you\" obligations\nprovided by the decentralized identity:\n\nHere we see multiple new things, let's try to explain them one by one.\nFirst, it is the global keyword used to define asset ticker and name as two\nstrings.\nWe already covered owned state composed of the rights holder and state atoms;\nbut in some situations a contract needs a state which is \"global\" for the\ncontract and is not \"owned\" by anyone (i.e. not assigned to a UTXO\nsingle-use-seal). The name of the asset (and ticker) is that sort of\ninformation: in the examples above it does not \"belong\" to a contract party but\ninstead is a \"property\" of the contract itself. Another example could be the\nname of the identity holder which can't be changed and thus can't be assigned to\na UTXO single-use-seal. Such state is defined with the global keyword.\nIt is important to note, that while the global state is not \"directly owned\" by\nany party, it still may be updated through state transitions -- but only if\nschema enables that explicitly. In such cases the use of the global state (as\ncompared to the owned state) is reasonable only when the user may opt-out from\nfuture state updates (i.e. do not define a new single-use-seals) but still needs\nto keep the state. The asset name is again such an example, since even if the\nasset can be renamed, future renames after certain renaming may be prohibited\n(i.e. no new owned state can be created), but the asset name should stay.\nglobal allows exactly that.\nSecond, the use of braces, brackets and question mark around and next to the\nstate name. Both braces and brackets mean that the operation works not with a\nsingle state atom, but instead an array (brackets) or set (braces) of state\natoms. Set differs from an array in the fact that all elements of the set must\nbe unique, while in array they may repeat. Coming back to our operations, asset\ntransfer may spend a number of assets from different owners, but all of them\nmust be unique (to prevent double-spend), i.e. form a set. However, when\ndefining a receivers, multiple state atoms may be equal (i.e. you can send\n10 tokens to the same UTXO N times, such that the receiver will get 10*N\ntokens in total, but through different \"inputs\", which may increase privacy).\nQuestion mark is used to inform that the state may be absent, i.e. in case of\narray or set it can be empty - or in case of a single item, it is optional.\nAt the very beginning we had mentioned so-called state extensions. State\nextension can be created by anybody without doing an on-chain commitment (i.e.\nwithout closing any single-use-seals). In this it is similar to genesis.\nHowever, the state created by the extension is not \"final\" (compare to a\nnon-mined transaction in the bitcoin mempool) until it gets included into a\nvalid state transition (like transaction gets mined by being included into\nbitcoin valid block).\nProbably the simplest way to understand state extensions is by example. Let's\nassume we'd like to do an asset which can be issued by anybody in the world\nthrough burning equivalent amount of bitcoins. Such operation can't be a state\ntransition, since we do not have a predefined set of single-use-seals to define\na \"rights of issue\" for an open and unknown set of participants. We can't also\ndo \"multiple geneses\", since each genesis will define a new RGB contract and\nthe assets under different RGB contracts are not fungible. State extensions\nwere created exactly to address this issue. A contract using them may look in\nthe following way:\n\n","id":"https://rgb.tech/program/contractum/fungibles/","title":"Adding fungible state"},"https://rgb.tech/program/contractum/interfaces/":{"body":"But how the wallet makes the sense of the contract? RGB contract can do a lot of things, and if schema developers would need to do a separate wallet for each schema the entrance threshold would be too high. To avoid such situation a concept of contract interface was created. A contract interface is a standard way communicating with RGB Node asking it for a semantically-meaningful state and creating operations. Such concept of interface is similar to the concept of ERC standards and ABI files in Ethereum world; the most common interfaces are called \"RGBxx\" and are defined as a separate LNP/BP standards.\nHere, instead of using existing interface standards we will create an interface for a generic fungible token from scratch to explain the way they work:\n\nRGB smart contract can implement multiple interfaces.

This also promotes re-use of common codebase by\ndifferent issuers for the same typical use cases (like fungible assets), \nreducing the risk of mistakes.\nRGB uses specially-designed virtual machine AluVM, which is Turing-complete in\nthe same terms as EVM and WASM-based smart contracts (i.e. nearly computational\nuniversal, but is bound by number of operation steps, measured by gas \nconsumption in Ethereum-like systems, and by accumulated computational \ncomplexity measure in case of AluVM).\n","id":"https://rgb.tech/program/overview/","title":"Overview of RGB development"},"https://rgb.tech/program/rust/":{"body":"NB: Work in progress – the chapter is not fully written yet and lack\nexplanation details for the code.
